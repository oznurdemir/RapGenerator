  <h1>Rap Generator</h1>

  <p>Hello everyone!</p>

  <p>Today, I'd like to introduce you to the "Rap Generator" application. When you log in to the application, you'll be greeted by an onboarding screen. After completing these screens, you'll reach the main page where you can create an original rap lyric based on the words you choose according to your mood by pressing the "Start" button. You can also rewrite or edit the generated lyric.</p>

  <p>When you navigate to the beat page, you can choose from beats provided by the API. On the following page, you can finalize your song by selecting artists from the API. Upon logging in again, users will encounter a paywall login screen. To remove this paywall, you'll need to purchase the app. Once the purchase is made, it will be automatically removed in the settings section.</p>
